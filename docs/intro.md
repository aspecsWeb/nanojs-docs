# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **NanoJS in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **cloning the repo**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Cloning the repo

Clone the repo from **aspecsWeb/nanojs**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aspecsWeb/nanojs.git
```

Then you need to install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:8080/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
